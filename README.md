## Overview

The IPL Win Probability Predictor uses machine learning techniques to forecast the outcome of IPL matches. The model is trained on various features such as team performance, player statistics, pitch conditions, weather, and more. By analyzing this data, the system outputs a probability of each team winning the match.

## Features
- Historical IPL match data integration.
- Player performance analysis (batting, bowling, fielding).
- Predicts match outcome based on multiple parameters.
- Real-time match predictions based on pre-match data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ipl-win-probability-predictor.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: After cloning, move into the project folder:
   
   cd ipl-win-probability-predictor
4. Install required dependencies: The project depends on several Python libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. Install them using:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Results
After running the prediction, the script will return the predicted win probabilities for each team. For example:

Predicted Win Probability:
- Mumbai Indians: 62%
- Chennai Super Kings: 38%
  
This information can be useful for analyzing and predicting IPL match outcomes.

Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy: Measures the percentage of correct predictions made by the model.
Confusion Matrix: Displays the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
